In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with type juggling and loose comparison. Consider this scenario:  ```php $value = '10'; if ($value == 10) { echo 'True'; } else { echo 'False'; } ``` This will output 'True' because PHP's loose comparison (`==`) performs type coercion before comparison.  However, if you were expecting strict type checking, the result is unexpected. Using strict comparison (`===`) would yield 'False' because the types are different ('string' vs 'integer').  This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in conditional statements or data validation where strict type matching is essential.
